#### Abstract
A generalized color-difference space was introduced based on theories of
multi-stage color vision, for example, the zone theory, and extended by
integrating line elements. This space had the following features: chromatic
adaptation, a linear transformation from CIE tristimulus values to cone
fundamentals, a nonlinear compression stage, a second linear transformation to
opponent signals, and line-element integration that was a function of chroma.
Variants of this generalized color-difference space were derived using the
RIT-DuPont and Qiao et al. datasets of equal perceived color differences. These
spaces had improved performance compared with CIELAB and resulted in a
Euclidean distance metric with statistically equivalent or superior performance
to the current CIE recommended color-difference formula, CIEDE2000.
